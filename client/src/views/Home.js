            The clones module allows creating and managing the execution of botâ€™s code.
            It also stores the metadata information of the clones and handles the interaction
            with the orchestration software.

            <Typography align='justify'>
            It integrates with other system modules to enable secure and encapsulated execution of the
            bots. On the clone creation process the encapsulation is achieved by deploying a Clone Executor
            Image on a Kubernetes container.

              Bots are executed using the common framework called Clone Executor which provides support for commonly used resources.

            <Typography align='justify'>
              When creating a new clone, specific execution parameters are selected, for example the exchange and the time period that the bot will operate in.
