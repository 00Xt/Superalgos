As such, a trading bot does not feature trading logic in and of itself. Instead, it executes the logic defined in trading systems."

One of the noteworthy sections of the infrastructure relevant to trading bots are trading mines themselves. Trading bots may be quite complex pieces of software. To name two of the most prominent characteristics: the bot needs to consider multiple dimensions of information and needs to be highly reliable, as its activity entails monetary transactions."
