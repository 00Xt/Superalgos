Charts are constantly updating the information in the form of candles and indicators in realtime, synchronized with the data being extracted from the exchange by the sensor bot. That kind of automatism is possible thanks to the events that processes trigger every time an execution cycle is finished, signaling to everyone listening that new data is available on each of the impacted datasets."
