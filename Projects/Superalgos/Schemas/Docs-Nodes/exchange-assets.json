Because many exchanges do not offer a list of assets, the system fetches assets from actual markets (pairs) listed at the exchange. You may add missing assets filtered by the quotedAsset or by the baseAsset. For example, the above configuration would add all assets listed in markets in which BTC is the quoted asset."
