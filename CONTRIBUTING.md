# Contributing

We are thrilled you are interested in contributing to this repository. Your help may be essential to the project's success and we want you in! 

Superalgos is a collective project, currently at a very early stage. We not only welcome contributions but may even choose to incentivize relevant contributions via the project's native crypto token.

Please read the [Join the Dev Team]( https://superalgos.org/developers-join-dev-team.shtml) page in our website to learn more about how you may become a relevant member of the Superalgos Project and even make a living out of contributing code.

Contributions are deemed _voluntary work_, irrespective of the incentives that may be in place, and are subject to the conditions described in the software [LICENSE](https://github.com/Superalgos/DesktopApp/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Getting Started

First step is to download, install and start using the app. The release includes all source code which constitutes your development environment right out of the package.

The priority at this moment is the stabilization of existing functionality. Your first contribution will be using and testing the app, and reporting any bugs you may find.

You may debug de code and remove bugs your self, and submit pull requests to the corresponding repositories. The name of the folder containing the code maps each of the repositories involved in the release.

As you engage with other developers and the Core Team, we will get to know you and develop a relationship, so that you may later participate in core development tasks.
