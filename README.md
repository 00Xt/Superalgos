## Documentation

The [Users Manual](https://github.com/Superalgos/Platform/wiki) in this repository's wiki features the documentation corresponding to the latest release.

The ```docs``` folder in this branch features the source files for a new [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) documentation site to be deployed along with the next release. The new version of the documentation is undergoing a massive restructuring, therefore, it may currently be inconsistent or hard to follow. 

To deploy the new documentation site in your local machine, run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) from the ```docs``` folder.

## Codebase and Development Environment

To build each release, the Superalgos Platform used to draw code from several repositories within the Superalgos Github organization, as well as from organizations belonging to Teams. This has changed.

The ```develop``` branch in this repository now features the latest codebase and development environment.  

The codebase is distributed with the platform's release, and constitutes a fully functional development environment right out of the package. The platform runs uncompilled on the actual code (```node run``` from the root folder).
