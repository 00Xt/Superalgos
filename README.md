# What is Superalgos?

Superalgos is a platform to automate crypto-tarding. It is a Nodejs + Web App that runs at your hardware and scales from a single Raspberry Pi to a Trading Farm.

## Superalgos allows you to:

* Design trading strategies.
* Download historical market data from crypto exchanges.
* Backtest your designs against historical data.
* Run live trading sessions.
* Create your own indicators.
* Create your own plotters to visualize at the charts your indicators.

## Superalgos Features:

* A Visual Scripting Designer.
* Integrated Charting System.
* Task Magagment across a Trading Farm.

# Superalgos for Developers:

* You are free to custumize Superalgos for your customers. No royalties, no license fees.
* Everything extra your customers might need you can code it yourself or request it as a new feature.
* You can use Superalgos as a platform or a component of a larger system.
* No propietary code / libraries. All open source and free.
* Already available a set of community contributed plugins (workspaces, strategies, indicators, plotters, tutorials, etc.)

## Superalgos saves you time:

* No need to code the download of historical data from crypto exchanges.
* No need to code the streming of market data from crypto exchanges.
* No need to hardcode strategies, use the visual designer for a more flexible approach.
* No need to debug what went wrong line by line or diving into log files with tons of data. You can see each variable of the state of the Trading Engine at every candle by hovering the mouse over the charts.
* No need to integrate a charing library, Superalgos has its own integrated Charting System.
* No need to manage task data or execution dependencies by yourself. Superalgos allows you to define Tasks and distribute them acrross a Trading Farm, and it takes cares of the data depencies and execution dependencies, so that each task automatically starts when their dependencies are ready.
