# Superalgos

Superalgos provides a toolbox with several integrated tools to design, test, and deploy automated crypto trading strategies, as well as research crypto markets. You can use Superalgos to download market data from crypto exchanges, make arbitrary calculations (including indicators), plot the results of your calculations over the charts, design trading strategies in a visual scripting environment that does not require coding, while still empowering developers by allowing it, and more. 

You may use individual features or the whole package, and reuse all information gathered and generated&mdash;standardized in multiple time frames, stored in text files sorted by exchange/market&mdash;as input for your own software/systems. 

Superalgos runs on your computer, it is free and open source.

## Documentation & FAQs

Please refer to the [documentation site](https://docs.superalgos.org/).

## Codebase and Development Environment

To build each release, Superalgos used to draw code from several repositories within the Superalgos Github organization, as well as from organizations belonging to different teams. This has changed.

* The ```develop``` branch in the [Superalgos repository](https://github.com/Superalgos/Superalgos/) now features the latest codebase and development environment (Beta 6).

* The ```master``` branch now features the latest stable version of Superalgos (Beta 5).

The codebase is distributed with the release and constitutes a fully functional development environment right out of the package. The system runs uncompiled on the actual code (```node run``` from the root folder).

It is highly recommended to follow the Getting Started guide in the [documentation](https://docs.superalgos.org/) as it not only gets you up and running but gives you a quick tour so that you may grasp the basics most efficiently.
