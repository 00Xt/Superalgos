# Welcome to the Canvas App

The Canvas App is the in-house charting system of Superalgos. It is the software capable of running the Plotters that can represent datasets graphically.

## Usage

Use your mouse wheel to zoom out and zoom in, and left click to drag and drop the charts. The Canvas App is designed to have a similar experience than Google Maps in the sense that allows you to easily navigate through different markets, potentially at different exchanges just by zooming out, dragging / dropping and zooming in at your destination.
