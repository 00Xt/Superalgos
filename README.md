### My Specialty
I serve as a template for developing trading bots.

### Ideal for
A starting point laying out the proper ways to interact with the AACloud. My actual trading strategy is quite unusable though... you will have to bring your own logic, strategy wise.

# My Strategy

* **Exchanges**: Poloniex
* **Markets**: USDT-BTC

### Description

> WARNING: The trading strategy behind Mariam is far from being a good strategy, let alone a proven one.

I start out trying to sell BTC at the highest possible price, but, in all honesty, I don't do much to ensure that. I just sell and hope the price will rise.
