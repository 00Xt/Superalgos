# Welcome to the Canvas App

The Canvas App is the in-house charting system of Superalgos. It is the software capable of running the Plotters that can represent datasets graphically.

## Installation 

To install the Canvas App, you need to install AAWeb. Please follow this guide:

https://github.com/Superalgos/AAWeb/blob/develop/README.md

## Usage

First time you enter you will see this screen, with no chart displayed, since the app exects you to select one of the available layers at the left panel:

Click on the first layer "Candles" and wait a few second to load the data and plot the candles chart. At that point you should see something like this:

As you can see, the candles belong to the market BTC/USDT @ Poloniex. Even though the app already support other markets and other exchanges, for us is better to have only this one active while the codebase matures. 



Use your mouse wheel to zoom out and zoom in, and left click to drag and drop the charts. The Canvas App is designed to have a similar experience than Google Maps in the sense that allows you to easily navigate through different markets, potentially at different exchanges just by zooming out, dragging / dropping and zooming in at your destination.
