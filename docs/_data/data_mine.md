data_mine: "A data mine is a hierarchy that contains definitions regarding sensor bots, indicator bots, and plotters, which extract data from third-party sources, process data, and produce the visualization of data over the charts, respectively."

indicator_bot: "An indicator bot is an algorithm that processes available information that other bots may have generated, and produces elaborate datasets for others to consume. The indicator bot node holds all definitions required for an indicator bot to function."

process_definition: "The process definition node groups all definitions required for a process to function. The Multi Period Market Process deals with time frames of one hour and above. The Multi Period Daily Process deals with time frames of 45 minutes and below."

process_output: "The process output defines which datasets are impacted by the process."

output_dataset: "The output data set is a reference to a dataset definition. The effect of establishing a reference from the output dataset to a product dataset definition is that—upon execution, every time the process finishes a processing cycle—the process triggers an event that may be consumed by other entities. These events indicate that the corresponding datasets (the ones impacted by the process as per the process output definition) have been updated."

process_dependencies: "Process dependencies are references to various data structures on which the process depends to function."

status_dependency: "Status dependencies define which other processes the process depends on."

data_dependency: "Data dependencies define which datasets the processes uses as input."

status_report: "Status reports serve as temporal annotations that bots read every time they run to know what was done in the previous cycle and what the state of affairs is at present. Status reports are dynamic, and they change constantly, with updates after every cycle of the associated process."

execution_started_event: "The execution started event is the event that triggers the execution of a process. It usually references the execution finished event of another process on which the process depends on."

execution_finished_event: "The execution finished event is the event that processes trigger once they have finished an execution cylce. The event is broadcasted to whoever wants to listen, so that other bots may know when the process has finished its execution cycle."

product_definition: "The product definition node holds all definitions that make up a product, including how the product is calculated and the datasets the product is comprised of."

dataset_definition: "A dataset definition contains a configuration file that defines all aspects of the dataset. There are two types of dataset definitions: multi period market and multi period daily."

record_definition: "The record definition is where indicators define how many fields, what fields and in which order those fields will be stored in each record."

record: "A record is the compendium of information stored for each period of time, including the start and end datetime of the period along with the properties that provide the information the indicator is meant to generate."

formula: "In the context of a record definition, formulas are used to assign a value to the property, usually in the form of a variable declared in the calculation or data building procedure."

calculations_procedure: "The calculations procedure processes information to be fed to calculated properties. Calculated properties are not stored in the data set; instead, they are calculated in real-time as the data is consume by others."

procedure_loop: "The procedure loop holds the JavaScript code that cycles through an input processing information to generate an output."

javascript_code: "The JavaScript code node may hold any snippet of valid JavaScript."

procedure_initialization: "The procedure initialization is used to initialize variables used by the procedure loop."

data_building_procedure: "The data building procedure processes information to be fed to properties that are stored in the output dataset."

plotter: "A plotter is a device used to produce a graphic representation of the data generated by indicators."

plotter_module: "A plotter module is a device within a plotter that contains the definitions to create the visualization, often times, for a particular product definition."

plotter_panel: "A plotter panel usually shows numerical representations of data over the charts on a small window or panel. The plotter panel node features definitions to make that possible."

panel_data: "A panel data node represents a data field to be plotted on the plotter panel."

data_formula: "A data formula is the device used to assign a value to the panel data, usually in the form of the name of the corresponding record property."

shapes: "The shapes node contains definitions that define polygons and styles to be rendered on a per period basis over the charts."

chart_points: "The chart points node groups definitions of points."

point: "A point is a definition of an [x,y] coordinate where x is usually a datetime and y is usually a value that refers to a price, as output by the indicator."

point_formula: "A point formula is the node used to input the coordinates of a point."

polygon: "A polygon features definitions that make up shapes and their styles."

polygon_vertex: "A polygon vertex is a reference to a point defined in the chart points, constituting a specific coordinate to be used as vertex of a shape."

polygon_border: "A polygon border is a shape defined by at least two vertices used to draw lines or to apply a style to the stroke of a closed shape."

style: "A style is a definition of color and opacity in case of a polygon body, and of color, opacity and line thickness in case of polygon borders."

style_condition: "A style condition is a rule that allows applying an alternative style in cases where the rule validates true."

polygon_body: "A polygon body is is the fill of a shape made out of at least 3 vertices."
