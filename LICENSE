LICENSE NOTICE

Advanced Algos LTD. is a startup, currently at a very early stage. Because certain aspects of 
the business are still not clearly defined, we have chosen to --temporarily-- grant a 
restrictive license for the use of AACloud, until those business aspects are clarified 
and a proper open source license can be granted.

Advanced Algos LTD. is publishing the code of this software for several reasons. However, 
it shall not be considered free software yet. Advanced Algos LTD. is a for-profit company 
in the crypto space and AACloud is still proprietary software.

The reasons for opening up the code of AACloud at this stage are the following:

  * We believe that transparency is paramount to achieving our goals, so we want everyone 
    to be able to understand what AACloud does and how. Opening up the code of AACloud allows 
    anyone to take a close look.

  * We welcome contributions from the community. Contributions are compensated on a case 
    by case basis with ALGO tokens. Contributions are deemed _work for hire_ and contributors 
    agree to provide an express grant of patent rights for their contributions.

  * We wish the community to be able to create their own bots running on AACloud, thus we grant
    a development and testing license so that developers can test their bots in their local 
    environment.
